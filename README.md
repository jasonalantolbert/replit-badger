# Repl.it Badger

Generates Markdown for adding a "Run on Repl.it" badge to the `README.md` file of a GitHub repository, such as:

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/jasonalantolbert/replit-badger)](https://repl.it/@jasontolbertjr/replit-badger)

You can't run this yourself directly from the repl that badge links to without forking it (I mean, you can, it just won't work).

Check it out: https://replit-badger.jasontolbertjr.repl.co/
